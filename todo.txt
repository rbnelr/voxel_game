DONE:
 
 collision not working properly on corners
 -> fixed, was a normalization of zero vector that caused nan
 -> 2nd. bug: needed to do raycasting on minowski sum of 5 blocks not 3
 
 implement collision in 3d
 implemented jumping
 
 implemented outlined block highlighting
 
 block placing
 
 block abient occulusion (AO)
 
 fix collision bug
 somtimes can still get stuck on the border of blocks when jumping
 -> i did not calculate the radius test correctly on raycasting with top and bottom of minowski sum
     so the collision was just not detected sometimes
 
 reimplement nice terrain with new noise function
 
 added water
 
 added imgui to replace my own dev/debug gui
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 remove my own dev/debug gui and reimplement the Immediate mode option code with imgui controls
 -remember to remove redundant stb text libs from deps/
 -clean up unused shaders from shaders/
 
 add trees
  -RNG seeded by chunk pos
  -generate random chance for each xy block column
  -calculate tree chance via tree desity noise layer and terrain type
  -spawn tree if random chance is above tree chance
  -maybe check if there already are trees nearby and dont spawn it in that case
  -also do this for all 8 surrounding chunks no matter if the're generated or not
  -this way we can generate leaves in our chunks of trees in a neibouring chunk
 
 improve block AO
 
 improve performance on notebook
 -chunk optimization
  -view frustrum culling
 
 redesign input system
 
 blocks inventory (gain blocks on break and lose on place)
 
-BUGS:
