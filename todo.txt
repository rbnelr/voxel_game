DONE:
 
 collision not working properly on corners
 -> fixed, was a normalization of zero vector that caused nan
 -> 2nd. bug: needed to do raycasting on minowski sum of 5 blocks not 3
 
 implement collision in 3d
 implemented jumping
 
 implemented outlined block highlighting
 
 block placing
 
 block abient occulusion (AO)
 
 fix collision bug
 somtimes can still get stuck on the border of blocks when jumping
 -> i did not calculate the radius test correctly on raycasting with top and bottom of minowski sum
     so the collision was just not detected sometimes
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 improve block AO
 
 improve performance on notebook
 -chunk optimization
  -view frustrum culling
 
 redesign input system
 
 blocks inventory (gain blocks on break and lose on place)
 
-BUGS:
