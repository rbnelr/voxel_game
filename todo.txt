DONE:
 
 collision not working properly on corners
 -> fixed, was a normalization of zero vector that caused nan
 -> 2nd. bug: needed to do raycasting on minowski sum of 5 blocks not 3
 
 implement collision in 3d
 implemented jumping
 
 implemented outlined block highlighting
 
 block placing
 
 block abient occulusion (AO)
 
 fix collision bug
 somtimes can still get stuck on the border of blocks when jumping
 -> i did not calculate the radius test correctly on raycasting with top and bottom of minowski sum
     so the collision was just not detected sometimes
 
 reimplement nice terrain with new noise function
 
 added water
 
 added imgui to replace my own dev/debug gui
 
 added basic tree generation
 -> uses a tree density noise layer
 -> tries to avoid trees being too close to each other by scaling the tree spawn propbablity based on how close other already spawned tress are (this is tree spawn order dependant, but that is deterministic with our method)
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 remove my own dev/debug gui and reimplement the Immediate mode option code with imgui controls
 -remember to remove redundant stb text libs from deps/
 -clean up unused shaders from shaders/
 -add viewing of any texture in imgui window
 
 immediate mode debug shapes
 -arrow for velocity acceleration etc.
 -path drawing: object user can put outside of main loop -output one point each frame -> get line of last n points
 -> try to get rid of as much code in main loop as possible by turning player collision cylinder, etc. into code using this
 -maybe even integrate vector viewing into my imgui debug variables (allow visualizing any vector that gets displayed in the imgui)
 
 redesign input system
 
 add trees
  -RNG seeded by chunk pos
  -generate random chance for each xy block column
  -calculate tree chance via tree desity noise layer and terrain type
  -spawn tree if random chance is above tree chance
  -maybe check if there already are trees nearby and dont spawn it in that case
  -also do this for all 8 surrounding chunks no matter if the're generated or not
  -this way we can generate leaves in our chunks of trees in a neibouring chunk
 
 improve block AO
 
 improve performance on notebook
 -chunk optimization
  -view frustrum culling
 
 blocks inventory (gain blocks on break and lose on place)
 
 work on gl abstraction
